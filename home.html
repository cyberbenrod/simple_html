<h1>Penguin Books</h1>
<p>Originally published in the United Kingdom, Penguin Books was 
concieved of by Sir Allen Lane in 1935 as a more literary alternative to the paperbacks that were sold to the general public at that time.
  Penguin paperbacks were sold for sixpence in Woolworth's and other stores,
 as well as in train stations through vending machines 
called Penguinators.  Penguin's immediate success was evidence that well
 written,
good quality paperback books marketed to the general public was a 
commercially viable scheme.  It was an idea that radically changed the book publishing industry.
