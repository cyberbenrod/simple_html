<h1>Everyman's Library</h1>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Everyman's Library</b> was first published as a series in 1906 by Joseph Malby Dent. The books were pocket-sized and the endpapers beautifully designed
 in the style of William Morris. A London publisher, Dent envisioned a 1,000-volume library for all readers. The originally price was only a shilling.
 Their low cost and good quality gave them a democratic appeal. Five hundred volumes were published by 1910, and the thousandth volume was published in 1956.</font></p>
